            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p id="text">In the world of Windows 8 programming, it is a sad truth that all languages are not created equal. In theory, any programming language can access any class or function available to Windows Store applications, but that’s only because the entire API is built on top of the Component Object Model (COM). In the real world of sane programming, the ease of accessing certain areas of the Windows 8 API depends on what programming language you’re using. For example, only programmers working with the managed languages of C# and Visual Basic have direct access to the .NET APIs for Windows 8 applications-those namespaces beginning with the word System. C++ programmers are expected to use C++ runtime libraries and classes in the Platform namespace for equivalent functionality. </p>
