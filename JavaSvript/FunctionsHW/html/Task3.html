            Windows Store apps are an important addition to Microsoft Windows 8, providing the
cornerstone for a single, consistent programming and interaction model across desktops,
tablets, and smartphones. The app user experience is very different from previous
generations of Windows applications: Windows Store apps are full-screen and favor a
style that is simple, direct, and free from distractions.
Windows Store apps represent a complete departure from previous versions of
Windows. There are entirely new APIs, new interaction controls, and a very different
approach to managing the life cycle of applications.
Windows Store apps can be developed using a range of languages, including
JavaScript, Visual Basic, C++, and, the topic of this book, C#. Windows 8 builds on the
familiar to let developers use their existing C# and XAML experience to build rich apps
and integrate into the wider Windows platform. This book gives you an essential jump
start into the world of Windows Store apps; by the end, you will understand how to use
the controls and features that define the core Windows Store app experience. windows windows
